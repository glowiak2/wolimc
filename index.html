      <h1>WoliMC</h1>
      <br>
      <p>WoliMC is a launcher for the game Minecraft free of political content.<br>
        No rainbows and other political things. It also has support for instances and [UPCOMMING] mods<br><br>
        <b>Aside that, WoliMC is written in Java and runs on every platform.</b>
        <br>
        Please have on mind that it's yet in very early stage and may not work properly.<br>
        It does not <b>yet</b> have Mojang/Microsoft authentication, so no chance to connect to servers like Hypixel at the moment.
        <br>If you want to download this monster anyway, see the bottom of this page.
